              <p> Tanvi and Ilia first met in the graduate dining hall at Harvard University, formerly called Dudley House,
              in their first year of graduate school. Tanvi was instantly charmed by Ilia's nerdism and 'play on words' halloween costume.
              Almost a year later, they started dating and the rest is history</p>

              <p> Ilia popped the question to a rather-unsuspecting Tanvi by a beach in Newburyport, to which she immediately said, 'yes'.
              Funnily, the first person they told about their engagement was a nice lady walking her pug. She was shocked and walked away after inital 'congratulations',
            but returned a few moments later and offered to take their first picture as an engaged couple. </p>

  <h3>Indian wedding details </h3>
  <p>India is a large and diverse country, and wedding traditions vary from region to region. Indian weddings are typically a multi-day event, and in some parts of India weddings can go for as long as a week. Our wedding will be two days (October 11-12) and will include several ceremonies and events. </p>

    <ul> <li> <h4>Mehndi and Sangeet: Oct 11, 2022, 7:00 PM </h4>

  <p>The first evening will include the Sangeet ceremony. In this event, guests and relatives come to greet and congratulate the bride and groom. The evening will include dinner, as well as performances, songs, and dances – the floor will be open to any guest or family member who wants to perform, including the bride and groom themselves.
  Mehendi artists will be present during the Sangeet, decorating the hands of the bride and groom with ornate henna designs. The hands of the couple’s family members will be decorated with henna as well, along with any other guests who are interested. </p>
</li>
<li> <h4>Shaadi: Oct 12, 2022, 5:00 PM </h4>
  <p>The second evening will be the main wedding ceremony (Shaadi). The ceremony is officiated by a pandit, who will light incense, recite passages in Sanskrit, and bestow blessings upon the couple. The marriage is sealed once the bride and groom walk around the ceremonial fire 7 times.
    From there, food and dancing will continue into the night.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Israeli wedding details </h3>

<p> Unlike Indian weddings, weddings in Israel are typically a one-day event. Our Israeli wedding will be on Oct 18, 2022</p>

  <ul> <li> <h4>Reception: 6:30 PM </h4>

<p> The evening begins with a reception, as guests arrive to the wedding hall, grab some appetizers, and greet the couple and their families. </p>
</li>

  <li> <h4>Huppah ceremony: 7:30 PM </h4>

<p>Next up is the marriage ceremony, which is traditionally officiated by a rabbi. The bride, groom and families gather under the Huppah – a canopy supported by four pillars, symbolizing the home the couple will build together. The ceremony includes the exchange of wedding rings, sipping from a cup of ceremonial wine, and several blessings and vows, concluding with the traditional breaking of a glass by the groom. While our wedding will not adhere to all religious aspects of the ceremony, it will be inspired by these traditions and include most of these elements. </p>
</li>
<li> <h4>Dinner and dancing: 8:00 PM </h4>
<p>After the Huppah ceremony draws to a close, the guests are invited to sit around the table to enjoy a hearty dinner, followed by a night of dancing and celebration. </p>
</li>
</ul>
